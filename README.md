A monopoly replica with integrated Photon in it. The project has these features:

* 1- 3d dice system, fully 3d and completely syncs with the server. 
* 2- tile system with pre-defined levels and tax&income system. 
* 3- multiplayer system that is completely sychronized on the first player. 
* 4- action and movement system based on the dice&multiplayer system

Made in a single month, currently the matchmaking and lobby part is not finished. But synchronization part for multiplayer has no seen problem and it works fine.
